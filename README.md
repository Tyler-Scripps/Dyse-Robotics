# Dyse-Robotics
This repo is the early stages of a project management framework. This project is essentially a wrapper for git, ROS and python3.

The idea for this project is to easily create and modify complex project spaces. Using the config files or user input the program can create new projects and load projects from git by creating duplicates of a base template.

this project is currently done entirely in setup.bash. Maybe in the future it will be switched to python based.

The next step is to test the git cloning functionality and make the program more user friendly (4/3/2021).
